# DevOps Meetup Phnom Penh, Cambodia

This talk is an brief introduction to devops and continuous delivery and how they fit together.

It uses images from websites to visualize the main painpoints that devops tries to tackle.

I tried to link everything back to the original sites, but for some picutes I didn't find any reliable sources.
